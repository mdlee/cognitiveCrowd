    "### Cognitive Wisdom of the Crowd\n",
    "\n",
    "The wisdom of the crowd is the idea that combining the knowledge of a group of people can lead to an answer that is better than most or all of the individuals in the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least three ways crowds might be wise:\n",
    "* **Finding someone who knows**. Some people know the answer, with certainty, to a general knowledge question like _What is the capital of Peru?_ A crowd can get the question right simply by having enough people to include somebody who knows the answer.\n",
    "* **Amplifying signal and canceling noise**. If a group of people _estimate the number of jelly beans in jar_, their estimates will be based on the common signal that is the ground truth and individual noise. An aggregation of the estimates will amplify the signal by cancelling the noise, leading to a more accurate group estimate.\n",
    "* **Completing a jigsaw**. For more complicted multidimensional question, different people may know different parts of the answer. For example, if a group of people is asked to _list the 45 US presidents in chronological order_, different individuals may know the order of presidents in different historical periods they have studied. Combining these pieces of knowledge leads to a more complete and accurate group answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As these examples make clear, the wisdom of the crowd phenomenon can be applied to various sorts of knowledge, including\n",
    "* **Scalar Estimation** An example is _How many US dollars does this surfboard cost?_.\n",
    "* **Probability Estimation** An example is _What is the probability Germany will win the next football world cup?_\n",
    "* **Free Choice** An example is _What is the capital of Peru?_ There is a single correct answer, but the alternatives are not made explicit.\n",
    "* **Binary Choice** An example is _Is a spider a mammal?_ Here there are just two alternatives\n",
    "* **Multiple Choice** An example is _What is the capital of Australia? A. Sydney, B. Melbourne, C. Canbera, D. Brisbane._ Here there are multiple alternatives that are explicitly presented.\n",
    "* **Sequential Choice** An example is to _choose a tour that visits every state capital in the US once and minimizes the total distance traveled_. The number of alternatives available decreases as the tour is chosen.\n",
    "* **Complete Ranking** An example is to _Rank the 45 US presidents in chronological order_, with all their names provided.\n",
    "* **Free Complete Ranking** An example is to _Rank the 45 US presidents in chronological order_, with no names provided.\n",
    "* **Top-n Ranking** An example is _Rank the 10 cities in the world from largest to 10th largest_, with the correct city names provided in a random order.\n",
    "* **Free Top-n Ranking** An example is _Rank the 10 cities in the world from largest to 10th largest_, with no potential city names provided, or the correct city names provided among a much larger set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wisdom of the crowd can also occur in various sorts of cognitive and social contexts, involving different sorts of access to relevant knowledge, and different goals and payoffs. Here are some different scenarios, that give some indication of the range of possibilities;\n",
    "* A competition with a single entry, and in estimating the number of jelly beans in a jar at a school fair. The closest estimate is the winner, so there is a zero-one payoff. The previous estimates may or may not be available at the time an individual makes their estimate.\n",
    "* An auction, in which people make competitive sequential bids, aware of what others are bidding, and attempting to win the auction with a bid that is at or below the value of the item being bidded on.\n",
    "* A ranking task involving known items might begin with the items sorted in a random order, or in the order provided by the previous individual in the group.\n",
    "* A forecasting competition, in which the probability of binary events are predicted. These forecasts could be incorporated in a complicated and dynamic aggregation mechanism like a prediction market.\n",
    "* Predictions of who will win a sporting competition. The ground truth is in-principle not able to be known. The predictions of others may or may not be available. The goal may be to maximize accuracy. Other more complicated social goals are also possible. For example, it may be important to avoid the embarrassment of not agreeing with a popular prediction that proves correct. Alternatively, there may be a large potential payoff in the notoriaty of picking an unlikely winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these tasks, for all of these situations, the insight behind the cognitive wisdom of the crowd is that The data that need to be aggregated are human behavioral data. They are the outputs of cognitive processes, based upon mental representations of knowledge. Thus, cognitive models are needed to infer **what people know from how they behave**, allowing crowd aggregation to be over individual knowledge that has been filter, de-biased, or de-contaminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete cognitive modeling approach will generally require a model of the cognitive process that produces the basic behavioral data, such as scalar estimation, choice, ranking, or sequences of these. This behavioral model will need to account for what information is available to the individual, the goals of the task, and the payoffs involved in motivating their behavior. Finally, it will require a model of the knowledge that individuals represent, and the structure of the individual differences across them. Thus, it requires modeling basic cognitive processes, individual differences in knowledge, and the task and social context.\n",

    "#### Scalar estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper involves bidding in a competitive game show setting. The rules of the bidding competition reward strategixc bids that often will not correspond to the value the individual believes is correct. A cognitive model is needed to infer what the individuals believe, from the bids they make.\n",

    "This paper involves the scalar estimation of products, known to be bounded between $0 and $50. Just three-person groups are studied. The interest is in how to extract the maximum aggregate information from a small group. There is evidence that competitive tasks might perform better.\n",

    "#### Probability estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper studies people's estimation of probabilities, assessed as actual oberved probabilities, rather than as latent probabilities underlying binar events. For example, people answer questions like _What proportion of the Earth's surface is covered in water?_ The cognitive model used to aggregate the estimates incorporates individual differences in expertise, and the standard finding that people miscalibrate probabilities by over-estimating very small probabilities and under-estimating very large ones.\n",
